# Hotel Room Booking Project

This project is a hotel room booking application where users can view available bookings, check room availability, and make reservations. It consists of both front end and back end components, utilizing Node.js, React, PostgreSQL, RESTful API, and various design and security elements.

## Technologies Used

### Front End
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Material-UI**: A popular React UI framework that provides pre-designed components following the Material Design guidelines.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Used for secure authentication and authorization of users.

### Back End
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime environment for server-side development.
- **Express.js**: A web application framework for Node.js used for building RESTful APIs.
- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful, open-source relational database system.
- **RESTful API**: Used for communication between the front end and back end, following REST architectural principles.

### Deployment and Infrastructure
- **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**: Cloud computing platform for hosting the application.
- **Terraform**: Infrastructure as code tool used for provisioning and managing AWS resources.
- **Docker**: Containerization platform for packaging the application and its dependencies.

## Features
- **Booking Management**: Users can view available bookings and make reservations.
- **Room Availability**: Real-time checking of room availability.
